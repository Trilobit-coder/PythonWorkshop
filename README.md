This repository contains all the code for SSTIA Python workshop. It has 3 parts in total, Introduction to Python, Python OOP tutorial and Common libraries tutorial. Designed for SJTU Global College students.

# Instructions

the wksp resources are designed to be completed during the workshop, but also available for you to complete at your own pace even without attending the workshop.(but I'd appreciate it if you could attend) 

## Opening the workshop in Google Colaboratory

The 2026 SSTIA Python Workshop will be run in Google's Colaboratory, a Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud, so you don't need to download anything. To run these Jupyter notebook files, ***you must have a Google account***.

On this Github repo, navigate to the [workshop folder](https://github.com/Trilobit-coder/PythonWorkshop/blob/main/workshop) and open the appropriate python notebook (\*.ipynb). Click the "Run in Colab" link on the top of the notebook. That's it!
